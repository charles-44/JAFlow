# JAFlow
JAFlow (Java Angular Flow) : Yet another light workflow engine. Playground for Charles team


## JAFlow (Java Angular Flow)

**Yet another lightweight workflow engine.**

JAFlow is a simple and modular playground designed for the Charles team to explore and grow with modern technologies such as **Java**, **Angular**, and **Docker**.  
This project aims to provide a hands-on learning environment while experimenting with core workflow concepts in a clean and extensible way.

Voici une section **"Modules"** propre et claire pour ton `README.md`, en anglais, intégrée dans le style de ta doc actuelle :
